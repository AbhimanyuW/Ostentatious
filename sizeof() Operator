Maya is interested to learn programming languages. When she is learning, she had a doubt on how to find the size of the variable. In C++, we have the sizeof() operator, which is used to get the size occupied by a variable or value. Now, write a C++ program to declare a variable of character, integer, float, and double type and print their respective sizes.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Print the corresponding size of a character, integer, float and double.
SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1
4
4
8

SOURCE CODE- 
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
  char a;
  int x;
  float f;
  double d;
  cout << sizeof(a) << "\n";
  cout << sizeof(x) << "\n";
  cout << sizeof(f) << "\n";
  cout << sizeof(d) << "\n";
  return 0;
  }
